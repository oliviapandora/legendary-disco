Dev Challenge Beaches: My Submission 

This year, DEV has started having different challenges for the users and I thought this would be a fun way for me to pratice my CSS. For this challenge, you kept the HTML file, but could add any CSS or JavaScript to make it prettier. My first thought was the 1950 convertables and an overall vintage vibe, which I used to pick my colors and picture. The overall design is simple, but I think the saturated colors make an impact. Once I learn JavaScript, I want to come back and make some more creative changes to see what I can come up with.
